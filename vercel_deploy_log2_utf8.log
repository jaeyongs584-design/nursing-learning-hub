Building: npm warn deprecated npmlog@5.0.1: This package

Building: npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This

much more comprehensive and powerful.

versions prior to v4 are no longer supported
Building: npm warn deprecated glob@7.2.3: Old versions 
of glob are not supported, and contain widely publicized
