 We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the 
directory of C:\Users\F1324\package-lock.json as the 
root directory.
 To silence this warning, set `turbopack.root` in your 
Next.js config, or consider removing one of the 
lockfiles if it's not needed.
   See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/
next-config-js/turbopack#root-directory for more 
information.
 Detected additional lockfiles:

Γ¿» ERROR: This build is using Turbopack, with a 
`webpack` config and no `turbopack` config.
   This may be a mistake.

   As of Next.js 16 Turbopack is enabled by default and
   custom webpack configurations may need to be 
migrated to Turbopack.

   NOTE: your `webpack` config may have been added by a 
configuration plugin.

   To configure Turbopack, see https://nextjs.org/docs/a
pp/api-reference/next-config-js/turbopack

   TIP: Many applications work fine under Turbopack 
with no configuration,
   if that is the case for you, you can silence this 
error by passing the
   `--turbopack` or `--webpack` flag explicitly or 
simply setting an 
   empty turbopack config in your Next config file 
(e.g. `turbopack: {}`).
